Frailty is defined as physical weakness or a lack of health and strength. Research has shown that lower grip strength is associated with higher frailty scores in females, and vice versa. Grip strength is typically measured using a dynamometer to quantify the amount of static force the hand can exert. This force is commonly measured in kilograms and pounds.


The table displays data from 10 female participants, including their height in inches, weight in pounds, age in years, and grip strength in kilograms. Frailty is a qualitative attribute that indicates the presence or absence of symptoms with N as No and Y as Yes.

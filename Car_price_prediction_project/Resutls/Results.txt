Data Analysis Summary on Car Dataset

1. Feature Engineering:
* Calculated Car_Age based on the current year and the car's manufacturing year.
* Created a Usage_Category (Fairly Used/Used More) based on the Kilometers_Driven. "Fairly Used" is set at 50,000 km. This categorization could be improved by considering factors like model and age.

2. Data Selection and Filtering:
* Selected key columns: Name, Location, Car_Age, Mileage, Price, Usage_Category.
* Filtered the data with criteria:
	- Car age (<= 5 years)
	- Price (< 1,000,000)
	- Usage Category ('Fairly Used')
* These filters significantly reduce dataset size, possibly excluding information on older or heavily used vehicles. Justifying these choices based on analysis goals would improve clarity.

3. Data Transformation:
* Renamed columns (Name to Car_Model, Price to Price_when_new(Lakhs)). The column Price_when_new(Lakhs) could be made more explicit, e.g., 'Initial_Price'.
* Extracted car make from Car_Model to create a Car_Make column, assuming itÃ•s always the first word. A more robust extraction method might be considered.

4. Data Sorting:
* Sorted data by Price_when_new(Lakhs) in ascending order.

5. Data Aggregation:
* Grouped data by Location and calculated average selling price per location to summarize pricing across regions.


Overall Comments:

* Clarity of Purpose: The analysis shows strong data manipulation skills, though the final analytical goal could be clearer. Comments clarifying why each step is applied (e.g., insights sought) would improve purpose clarity.

* Filter Justification: The criteria for filtering data could use a clearer justification (e.g., why these age, price, and usage thresholds are applied).

* Robust Car Make Extraction: A more reliable method for extracting car make could be considered, as the current method assumes it is always the first word in Car_Model.

* Further Analysis Potential: The analysis could be enhanced with additional exploration, such as feature correlations, visualizations for patterns, or advanced statistical models.

* Potential Bias: Applying filters may introduce bias by limiting the dataset. If the goal is a broad understanding of car pricing, excluding data based on specific filters could lead to skewed results.
